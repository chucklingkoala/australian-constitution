The below is an example of what i believe we should add to our constitution to clarify for future governments: that Australians have freedoms that we will not allow them to violate, and to limit the powers of said governments.


# Proposed Amendments to the Australian Constitution

AND WHEREAS these rights exist independently of government and require express constitutional protection against encroachment;

The following amendments are proposed to be inserted as a new **Chapter IX—Rights and Freedoms** after Chapter VIII of the Constitution:

---

The rights under subsections (1) to (4) may be restricted by law only where necessary to prevent:

(a) direct and imminent incitement to specific violent acts where such incitement is objectively likely to produce such violence immediately;

(c) fraud, defamation, or breach of contract, provided such restrictions are defined with precision and applied according to established common law principles;

```
Any restriction permitted under subsection (6) must be content-neutral in both purpose and effect. No restriction shall be imposed based on the viewpoint expressed, the political position advocated, or the subject matter discussed.
```

(8) **Prohibited Restrictions**

```
Nothing in subsection (6) shall permit laws that:

(a) require licenses, permits, or prior approval for expression, publication, assembly, or association;

(c) compel speech, including compelled disclosure of identity for anonymous speech;

The exclusionary rule extends to:
(a) all evidence directly obtained through the violation;

(c) evidence obtained by private parties acting under direction of government authorities.

No court may create exceptions to this rule based on:

(a) the accused poses an immediate and substantial threat to the physical safety of an identified person; and
(b) no conditions of release would adequately address this threat.

Bail shall not be denied on grounds of:
- risk of flight;
- seriousness of the offence;

- previous convictions.

Any detention pending trial shall count as double time served if convicted.

A fine is excessive if it:
(a) exceeds the financial benefit obtained from the offence;
